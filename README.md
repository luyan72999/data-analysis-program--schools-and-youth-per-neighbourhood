# Data Dashboard for School and Youth Analysis in Vancouver




## Purpose
The purpose of this data dashboard is to assess the adequacy of schools in relation to the number of young people in each neighborhood of Vancouver. 


This is achieved by calculating the number of schools, the number of young students aged 5 to 19, and the average number of students per school in each neighborhood. 


Additionally, users can find detailed information about the schools and the number of young students in a specific neighborhood.
